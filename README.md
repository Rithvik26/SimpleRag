2. **Text Chunking**: Split documents into overlapping chunks
3. **Vector Embeddings**: Generate embeddings using Gemini API
4. **Vector Storage**: Store in primary Qdrant collection
5. **Semantic Search**: Find similar chunks using vector similarity
6. **Answer Generation**: Use Claude LLM with retrieved context

### Graph RAG Flow
1. **Document Processing**: Parse and extract text from uploaded files
2. **Context-Rich Chunking**: Create larger chunks for better entity context
3. **Entity Extraction**: Use Gemini to identify entities and relationships
4. **Knowledge Graph**: Build NetworkX graph with entities as nodes, relationships as edges
5. **Graph Embeddings**: Generate embeddings for entities and relationships
6. **Dual Storage**: Store documents in primary collection, graph elements in graph collection
7. **Hybrid Search**: Search both document chunks and graph elements
8. **Enhanced Answer Generation**: Use Claude with both document and graph context

```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Configure through the web interface Settings tab or via command line:

```bash
# Set RAG mode and basic parameters
simplerag config --rag-mode graph --chunk-size 1000 --top-k 5

# Configure Graph RAG specific settings
simplerag config --max-entities-per-chunk 20 --graph-reasoning-depth 2
```

### Key Parameters

#### Normal RAG Settings
- `chunk_size`: Size of text chunks in characters (500-5000)
- `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between chunks (50-500)
- `top_k`: Number of results to retrieve (1-20)

#### Graph RAG Settings
- `max_entities_per_chunk`: Maximum entities to extract per chunk (5-50)

## RAG Mode Comparison

| Feature | Normal RAG | Graph RAG |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Speed** | Fast ‚ö° | Slower but thorough üß† |
| **Processing** | Simple chunking | Entity extraction + graph building |
| **Storage** | Single collection | Dual collections (docs + graph) |
| **Best For** | Direct facts, simple Q&A | Relationships, complex reasoning |
| **Use Cases** | "What is the revenue?" | "How are X and Y connected?" |

## Advanced Features

### Knowledge Graph Construction

Graph RAG automatically:
- Extracts entities (people, organizations, concepts, locations, events)
- Identifies relationships between entities
- Builds a NetworkX graph for traversal and analysis
- Stores graph elements with semantic embeddings

### Hybrid Search Strategy

When using Graph RAG, the system:
1. Searches document chunks for direct content matches
2. Searches graph elements for entity and relationship matches
3. Combines results for comprehensive context
4. Generates answers using both document and graph information

### Admin Interface

Access `/admin` for:
- **System Status**: Real-time service health monitoring
- **Collection Management**: Create, inspect, and delete Qdrant collections
- **Debug Tools**: Test queries and inspect search results
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor API usage and cache effectiveness

### Rate Limiting & Caching

- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Prevents API quota exhaustion with automatic throttling
- **Embedding Cache**: Reduces costs by caching frequently used embeddings
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates for long-running operations

## API Endpoints

Enhanced SimpleRAG provides RESTful API endpoints:

```bash
# System status
GET /api/system/status

# RAG mode management
GET /api/rag-mode
POST /api/rag-mode {"mode": "graph"}

# Collection management
GET /api/admin/qdrant/collections
POST /api/admin/qdrant/collections {"type": "graph"}
DELETE /api/admin/qdrant/collections/{name}

# Progress tracking
GET /api/progress/{operation_type}
```

## Use Cases

### Normal RAG - Perfect For:
- ‚úÖ Quick factual queries
- ‚úÖ Direct information extraction
- ‚úÖ Simple document search
- ‚úÖ Performance-critical applications

### Graph RAG - Ideal For:
- üß† Understanding relationships between entities
- üîó "How are X and Y connected?" questions
- üìä Complex multi-entity queries
- üéØ Contextual reasoning and inference

## Example Queries

```bash
# Normal RAG queries
"What is TechCorp's revenue?"
"Who is the CEO?"
"What products does the company offer?"

# Graph RAG queries  
"How are TechCorp and Microsoft related?"
"What partnerships exist between the mentioned companies?"
"Who are the key people involved in the acquisitions?"
"What is the relationship between Sarah Chen and the board members?"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No results in Graph RAG mode:**
- Check that both document and graph collections exist in admin panel
- Verify entity extraction is working in the debug console
- Try simpler queries first to test connectivity

**Slow Graph RAG performance:**
- Reduce `max_entities_per_chunk` for faster processing
- Enable embedding cache to reduce API calls
- Consider using Normal RAG for simple queries

**Collection errors:**
- Use the admin interface to recreate collections
- Check Qdrant connection status
- Verify API keys are correctly configured

### Debug Tools

Access the admin panel (`/admin`) for:
- Collection inspection and management
- Query debugging with result scoring
- System status and error monitoring
- Cache management and clearing

## Performance Tips

1. **Choose the Right Mode**: Use Normal RAG for simple queries, Graph RAG for relationship questions
2. **Enable Caching**: Significantly reduces API costs and improves speed
3. **Optimize Chunk Size**: Larger chunks for Graph RAG, smaller for Normal RAG
4. **Monitor Progress**: Use the real-time progress indicators for long operations
5. **Use Admin Tools**: Regular collection maintenance improves performance
